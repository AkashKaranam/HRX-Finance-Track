# HackRiceX | Finance Track

## Track Description

In the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, economies around the globe have been significantly impacted: from plummeting stocks to businesses shutting down and record high unemployment rates in some places. Many aspects of the economy have become more reliant on technology throughout the years, but the spread of COVID-19 has expedited this process. 

## Prompt

The goal of this track is for you to create a useful financial tool to help in times of financial crisis. Your goal should be to create something from scratch, or change something that exists. You can focus on any aspect of the economy or the stock market. This track is intentionally broad; we’re open to seeing a broad range of projects. 

For the presentation, you should explain the problem you are addressing, describe what data you used, if any, and discuss the significance and impact of your project.

This track will be judged based on creativity, significance and impact of results, and presentation quality.

Some potential ideas are:
* An app that promotes small businesses as an alternative to big chains for consumers
* A platform that predicts stock behavior
* An application that facilitates working from home or away from the workplace
